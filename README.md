How to launch a project?🤔
-----------------------
In the terminal:
cd client -> npm run dev

Then, in the new terminal:
cd server -> npm run dev

How do I register?🧐
-------------------------
Profile -> enter user data -> click on the "Register" button.
Then you will receive an email with a link to confirm your account at the specified email address. You need to click on the link, after which the account will be activated.

Now you can make purchases😊
